# Facial Recognition using MobilenetV2 and RetinaFace

This project implements facial recognition using MobilenetV2 for feature extraction and RetinaFace for face detection. It is designed to recognize faces in images using pre-trained models and databases.

## Features

- Face detection using RetinaFace.
- Facial feature extraction using MobilenetV2.
- Database integration for storing recognized faces.
- Example usage with sample images.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamzaabid016/hamzaabid016-facial-Recognition-using-MobilenetV2-and-RetinaFace.git
   cd hamzaabid016-facial-Recognition-using-MobilenetV2-and-RetinaFace
   ```
2  **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3   Download pre-trained models (if necessary) and place them in the appropriate directories.

## Usage
run this command in cmd
```bash
python app.py
```
after running app.py the fastapi opens and you can add upload the image and then i will recognize the face
you can integrate the api to the frontend of the app or web


## File Structure
**app.py**: Main application script.
**requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies.
