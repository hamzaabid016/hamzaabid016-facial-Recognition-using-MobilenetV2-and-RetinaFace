# Facial Recognition using MobilenetV2 and RetinaFace

This project implements facial recognition using MobilenetV2 for feature extraction and RetinaFace for face detection. It is designed to recognize faces in images using pre-trained models and databases.

## Features

- Face detection using RetinaFace.
- Facial feature extraction using MobilenetV2.
- Database integration for storing recognized faces.
- Example usage with sample images.
